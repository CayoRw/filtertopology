#Digital Filter with Topology Visualization
This project implements a digital filter from user-supplied parameters (Amax, Amin, Ws, and Wp). The code calculates the corresponding transfer function (TF), locates the poles of the system, and presents the topologies of the equivalent circuits using two approaches: Multiple Feedback (MFB) and Sallen-Key. In addition, the values ​​of the components required to implement these circuits are calculated and displayed.
